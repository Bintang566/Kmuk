# XOR-crypter
This software protects you assemblies by encrypting each byte with strong XOR algorithm
# How does it works
- Crypter encodes your file and adds it to stub as cipher bytes
- Then stub is executed, it decrypts payload bytes and invokes it without dropping on disk, so Anti-Viruses are not able to scan it
# Instruction
- Disable your running AV, especially sample sending and real-time protection functions
- Download the release file, execute and choose a file to crypt. It`ll be saved as Crypted.exe
- now go to https://freeobfuscator.com/ , upload Crypted.exe and save the result
- visit antiscan.me or kleenscan.com (❗❗❗NOT VIRUSTOTAL❗❗❗) and scan the final file
- if you don`t like the result, obfuscate with other service, wait for stub update or edit the source code of project to make stub FUD again
